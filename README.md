# Original Documentation:
# Basic Mod

This is an empty Slay the Spire mod + a modding tutorial.

This tutorial will help with setup and the basics of Slay the Spire modding, but it will not teach you Java. If you know nothing of Java or programming in general, you are strongly recommended to look up a free online course and do at least some of it. It is possible to do modding with almost no proper knowledge, but it will make things much more difficult.
